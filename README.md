# QC_lattice_H
(First version)
A python code that builds Hamiltonian on a generic N × N lattice, both with open and periodic boundary conditions. The formulation considered is from Kogut and Susskind and the Gauss’ law is applied.
By doing so, we will get a gauge invariant system, reduce the number of dynamical links needed
for the computation, and have a more resource-efficient Hamiltonian suitable for a wide range of
quantum hardware.
